    The prevalence of opioid prescriptions among veterans increased from 18.9% to 33% from 2004-2012.In a meta-analysis 
    conducted among patients who had been prescribed opioids for chronic pain;  ten predictors were used to see how high in 
    relation they were to opioid overdoses. It was found that the mental health indicators for this study used bipolar disorder,
    depression, and other mental health disorders proved to be moderate indicators of opioid fatalities. However, another 
    indicator was history of prescription of fentanyl and other opioids. This indicator had a high risk of association, that  
    resulted in fatalities from opioids.

    According to (Warfield, Karras, Lilly, Brumage, & Bossarte, 2021), a cohort study was conducted consisting of only veterans who had prior history of a non-fatal overdose and veterans who had no history of opioid overdose. This study 
    identified 8370 Veterans with a history of nonfatal opioid overdose and a total follow-up of 39,207 person-years. The veterans that 
    had history of prior opioid non-fatal overdose, approximately 17.4 % of them experienced death in the follow-up of the study. In 
    this study the most common causes of death amongst veterans were identified.Veterans who had history of non-fatal opioid overdose 
    were two times more likely to die from suicide in comparison to the veteran group with no history of opioid overdose. About 30% of 
    veterans who use VA services had a prevalence of overdose from opioids between 2001-2009. The rise quickly went up to 65% of the 
    veteran population from 2010-2016
