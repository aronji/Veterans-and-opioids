    It is not a secret that many military veterans especially those involved in war were prescribed opioids for chronic pain.
    The prevalence of opioid prescriptions among veterans increased from 18.9% to 33% from 2004-2012. .  In a meta-analysis 
    conducted among patients who had been prescribed opioids for chronic pain;  ten predictors were used to see how high in 
    relation they were to opioid overdoses. It was found that the mental health indicators for this study used bipolar disorder,
    depression, and other mental health disorders proved to be moderate indicators of opioid fatalities. However, another 
    indicator was history of prescription of fentanyl and other opioids. This indicator had a high risk of association of 
    resulting in opioid fatalities.
