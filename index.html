           The opioid crisis has been a public health issue for a while now and this crisis can be linked to many factors including socioeconomic background, race, and incarceration. In 2023 alone, there were 2,463 drug overdoses in Virginia. Out of these deaths, 79% of them were from opioids “Drug Overdose and Related Health Outcomes” (n.d.). Also, in 2023 there were 21,881 drug overdoses in Virginia that required emergency department visits “Drug Overdose and Related Health Outcomes” (n.d.).  The opioid crisis is also linked to mental health. Those who are predisposed to having PTSD, depression, and anxiety were common mental disorders found in individuals who had opioid use disorder (Santo et al., 2022).  According to (Santo et al., 2022),      those with comorbid mental disorders are more likely to have a more severe opioid addiction compared to others. I would like to explore the origins of opioid addiction in combat veterans and solutions to solving the crisis.   <!-- End --></p>
