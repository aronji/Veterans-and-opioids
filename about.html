    <h3>About</h3>

    While there are many factors that go into why combat veterans fall victim to opioid addiction, I would primarily like to shift the focus onto the root causes of addiction and how this crisis can be improved upon to make this group aware of their options and solutions. 

    , many who serve in the military are susceptible to mental health disorders, such as depression anxiety, and suicidality. Evidence has shown that anxiety and depression can increase the mortality and morbidity risk during the use of opioids. Suicide is a just one of the many mental health issues among military veterans, especially those who served in Afghanistan or Iraq. Military individuals, depending on position and or ranking have different experiences in the service. Studies have shown a high correlation between suicide, substance abuse in the non-military populations. In the veteran populations, suicide is directly linked to opioid use. In a systematic review and meta-analysis on the prevalence of specific mental health disorders on those with opioid use disorder, one-hundred-thousand participants were involved. From this study it was concluded that there were increased rates of depression, anxiety, PTSD, OCD, panic disorder, bipolar disorder, ASPD, borderline personality disorder, ADHD, psychotic disorders, and schizophrenia found in individuals who were diagnosed with opioid use disorder.
