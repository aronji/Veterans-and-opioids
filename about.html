   Those who serve in the military are susceptible to mental health disorders, such as depression anxiety, and 
    suicidality. Evidence has shown that anxiety and depression can increase the mortality and morbidity risk during 
    the use of opioids. Suicide is a just one of the many mental health issues among military veterans, especially 
    those who served in Afghanistan or Iraq. Military individuals, depending on position and or ranking have different 
    experiences in the service. Studies have shown a high correlation between suicide, substance abuse in the non-military
     populations. In the veteran populations, suicide is directly linked to opioid use. In a systematic review and 
     meta-analysis on the prevalence of specific mental health disorders on those with opioid use disorder, one-hundred-thousand 
     participants were involved. From this study it was concluded that there were increased rates of depression, anxiety,
      PTSD, OCD, panic disorder, bipolar disorder, ASPD, borderline personality disorder, ADHD, psychotic disorders, and 
      schizophrenia found in individuals who were diagnosed with opioid use disorder.
        
        
        there are a mulititude of factors that contribute to why combat veterans fall victim to opioid addiction, I would primarily 
    like to shift the focus onto the root causes of addiction and how this crisis can be improved upon to combat opioid misuse in this population.
