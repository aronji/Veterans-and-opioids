    The VA offers many mental health services like; outpatient treatment, inpatient treatment, rehabilitation programs, 
    primary care, and Veterans mental health crisis hot line. The theme that continues the most in terms of Veterans Affair services is how quick the treatment services are conducted. 
    Manning is a significant issue for medical personnel for VA hospitals. In 2024 the Office of Healthcare Inspection reported that 86% of facilities were short on medical officers and 82% were short on nurses. Interestingly, psychology
    was frequently reported as having severe shortage in personnel.  Often, veterans will have an emergency or need to seek treatment for a mild issue and cannot be seen by their primary doctor. Most only 
    see their primary doctor about two times a year. For every one veteran doctor, there can be an upwards of 1,200 patients just for that one doctor. In most cases, veterans are sent out to civilian physicians for 
    specialty care.

    According to (Humphreys et al., 2022), the Veterans Health Administration employed three hundred pharmacists to provide evidence-based,
    in-person education about prescription drugs to medical staff. Opioid prescribing was monitored, and clinicians were equipped to 
    monitor patients’ risk profile and history of drug abuse (Humphreys et al., 2022). However, some veterans have still complained 
    of pain not being treated as effectively because of the non-use of opioids as much. The guidelines were established with good 
    intentions. In 2016 the CDC’s guidelines for opiates focused more on tapering and stopping the prescribing of the medication 
    (Edens, Gabriela Garcia Vassallo, & Heimer, 2024) . With this, there was a vagueness of what other pain treatments should be used or 
    deterred from using. According to (Edens, Gabriela Garcia Vassallo, & Heimer, 2024), those who were dependent on opioids turned to
    much worse illegal drugs. From 2016-2021, deaths from opioid misuse doubled. These guidelines did not get much improvement until 
    2022. In conclusion, veterans would really benefit from expanding access and knowledge about Veterans Health Services, continuing 
    to advance provider education, strengthening collaboration between the Department of Defense in the Veterans Health administration 
    in terms of transitioning from active duty and opioid use prevention.
