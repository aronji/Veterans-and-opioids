    The VA offers many mental health services like; outpatient treatment, inpatient treatment, rehabilitation programs, primary care, 
    and Veterans mental health crisis hot line. The theme that continues the most in terms of Veterans Affair services is how quick the 
    treatment services are conducted. Manning is a significant issue for medical personnel for VA hospitals.

    In 2024 the Office of Healthcare Inspection reported that 86% of facilities were short on medical officers and 82% were short on nurses. 
    Interestingly, psychology was frequently reported as having severe shortage in personnel.  Often, veterans will have an emergency or need 
    to seek treatment for a mild issue and cannot be seen by their primary doctor. Most only see their primary doctor about two times a year. 
    For every one veteran doctor, there can be an upwards of 1,200 patients just for that one doctor. In most cases, veterans are sent out to 
    civilian physicians for specialty care.

        Evolving Policies Within Veteran's Affairs Health Services

    <p><!-- You can type your stuff here : Start-->  
    The Veterans Health Administration employed three hundred pharmacists to provide evidence-based, in-person education about prescription 
    drugs to medical staff. Opioid prescribing was monitored, and clinicians were equipped to monitor patients’ risk profile and history of 
    drug abuse. However, some veterans have still complained of pain not being treated as effectively because of the non-use of opioids as 
    much. The guidelines were established with good intentions.

    In 2016 the CDC’s guidelines for opiates focused more on tapering and stopping the prescribing of the medication.  With this change, there 
    was a vagueness of what other pain treatments should be used or deterred from using.Those who were dependent on opioids turned to much 
    worse illegal drugs. From 2016-2021, deaths from opioid misuse doubled. These guidelines did not get much improvement until 2022. In 
    conclusion, veterans would really benefit from expanding access and knowledge about Veterans Health Services, continuing to advance 
    provider education, strengthening collaboration between the Department of Defense in the Veterans Health administration in terms of 
    transitioning from active duty and opioid use prevention.

       Testimonials from Veterans/Providers on Opioid Addiction Treatment At the VA
    <!-- End --></h2>
    <p><!-- You can type your stuff here : Start-->
    <ol>
        <li>
            <h3>Organizational Issues:</h3>
            In a qualitative research study conducted on the veterans/provider perspectives on the prescribing and
            accepting of opioids; veteran interviewees mentioned that resources were a challenge due to staffing shortages
            of RN's and LPN's
            to assist in inductions for Medications of Opioid Misuse Disorder(MOUD).
            <p><b>Nurse Testimonial:</b> “I’m afraid of that for the regular PACT team with only 1 RN and 1 LPN assigned and
                a large panel with
                lots of daily tasks….”</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Veterans Starting Treatment:</h3>
            <p><b>Veteran 1:</b> I was with a girl…and I made a commitment with her [to get sober] and then she passed away.
                And I felt that I
                had to stick to that commitment.</p>
            <p><b>Veteran 2:</b> “I had a sponsor at AA and he was a Veteran and he told me I should go to the VA and see if
                they could help me.” </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Personal Barriers:</h3>
            Veteran Interveiwees expressed throughout the proccess how providers had stereotypes on patients battling
            substance abuse disorders and are not comfortable setting boundaries with patients
            <p><b>Provider:</b> "Most of our narcotic users are pain patients, not heroin/street drug users. The PCPs put
                ‘Opioid Use Disorder’in
                the chart per [assessment] template but don’t have the patient education discussion, so then the patients
                are upset when they hear
                about the diagnosis."</p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <h3>Veteran Patients on opioid treatment: </h3>
            <p><b>Veteran 1: </b>"The whole time I was on methadone, I didn’t feel on top of it- the itch was always there.
                And that didn’t go
                away until I started Suboxone ten years later, and that was like night and day."</p>
            <p><b>Veteran 2: </b>"I have a condition where I have the worst pain known to man. This medication [Suboxone]
                keeps me feeling normal
                and knocks my pain down to a level I can deal with. ….It saved my life."</p>

         Present Day 
    <!-- End --></h3>
    <p><!-- You can type your stuff here : Start-->
        In the current presidential administration, there are many changes being made but the main one is government cuts that are affecting Veterans 
        Affairs. Many Veteran’s Affairs staff and or personnel are being laid off, including those that research opioid addiction, cancer 
        research, and other specialties. Allocating more funds to Veteran’s affairs for staffing and providing more resources to veterans 
        can shorten the amount of time it takes to be seen regarding mental health and or addiction issues as well as providing a higher 
        quality of care for patients. It would also be helpful in continually training providers on how to approach and handle substance/
        prescription abuse patients and how to set proper boundaries. In the midst of the current political climate, it is significant for 
        the Veterans Health Administration to strengthen relations with current stakeholders and  engage with new partners as well. This 
        would ensure that even with little govenrment support, Veteran's Affairs would be able to continue to research and bring about 
        change with the opioid addiction issue. Possible organizations that could be partners/stakeholders are; the CDC, Amercian Adiction 
        Centers, The PTSD Foundation of America, and Make the connections just to name a few.
