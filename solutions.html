    The VA offers many mental health services like; outpatient treatment, inpatient treatment, rehabilitation programs, 
    primary care, and Veterans mental health crisis hot line (VA, 2019) . After speaking with several family members and 
    close friends who are veterans, the theme that continues the most is how quick treatment services are conducted. 
    Manning is a significant issue for medical personnel for VA hospitals. According to the Office of Healthcare Inspections
    (2024), in 2024 86% of facilities were short on medical officers and 82% were short on nurses. Interestingly, psychology
    was frequently reported as having severe shortage in personnel(Office of Healthcare Inspections, 2024). Often, veterans
    will have an emergency or need to seek treatment for something mild and cannot be seen by their primary doctor. Most only 
    see their primary doctor about two times are year because for every one veteran doctor, there can be an upwards of 1,200 
    patients just for that one doctor (O’Shea et al., 2023). In most cases, veterans are sent out to civilian physicians for 
    specialty care etc. to solve whatever immediate medical issues they have.

    According to the (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2018), government accountability access report
    found that of the 91,764 service members who received a misconduct separation between fiscal years (FY) 2011 and 2015, 62 
    percent (57,141) were diagnosed with PTSD or a TBI within 2 years of their separation. Of the 57,141, 23 percent (12,283) 
    received an OTH discharge. These veterans did not receive mental health care. According to (National Academies of Sciences, 
    Engineering, and Medicine, 2018), in 2017 VA Secretary David Shulkin announced that the VA would offer emergency mental health 
    care to veterans with an OTH discharge status as part of its ongoing efforts to prevent veteran suicides (VA, 2017e). With this 
    initiative, veterans with other than honorable discharge were able to seek treatment at a VA emergency department, Vet Center, 
    and contact the Veterans Crisis Line (National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2018). With the expanding 
    eligibility for service members, some veterans were not sure if they qualified for certain health care services. It was reported
    that many veterans reported a lack of knowledge about veterans’ affairs even after completing the TAP program (National Academies
    of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine, 2018). The (TAP) program serves as a transitional assistance program for service members
    before they go from active duty to veteran status. According to the research (Bennett et al., 2022),  only 6.1 million of 
    the total 20.3 million veteran population have used VA healthcare.

    According to (Humphreys et al., 2022), the Veterans Health Administration employed three hundred pharmacists to provide evidence-based,
    in-person education about prescription drugs to medical staff. Opioid prescribing was monitored, and clinicians were equipped to 
    monitor patients’ risk profile and history of drug abuse (Humphreys et al., 2022). However, some veterans have still complained 
    of pain not being treated as effectively because of the non-use of opioids as much. The guidelines were established with good 
    intentions. In 2016 the CDC’s guidelines for opiates focused more on tapering and stopping the prescribing of the medication 
    (Edens, Gabriela Garcia Vassallo, & Heimer, 2024) . With this, there was a vagueness of what other pain treatments should be used or 
    deterred from using. According to (Edens, Gabriela Garcia Vassallo, & Heimer, 2024), those who were dependent on opioids turned to
    much worse illegal drugs. From 2016-2021, deaths from opioid misuse doubled. These guidelines did not get much improvement until 
    2022. In conclusion, veterans would really benefit from expanding access and knowledge about Veterans Health Services, continuing 
    to advance provider education, strengthening collaboration between the Department of Defense in the Veterans Health administration 
    in terms of transitioning from active duty and opioid use prevention.
